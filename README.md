# Weather NOW
In progress...<br>
Weather NOW is a React front end app that uses the data from an external API to provide information about the current values in a city picked by user input.

## How to use
Fork and clone the repo.
The credentials for the weather API are in a .env file that has been gitignored. To be able to connect to the API you'd have to create an account [here](https://openweathermap.org/api) or get in touch with me.
To run the app use `npm start`.
